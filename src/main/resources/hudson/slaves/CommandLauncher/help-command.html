  Command to be used to launch an agent program, which controls the agent
  computer and communicates with the master. Jenkins assumes that
  the executed program launches the <code>agent.jar</code> program on the correct
  machine.

  <p>
    A copy of <code>agent.jar</code> can be downloaded from <a href="${rootURL}/jnlpJars/agent.jar">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a simple case, this could be
    something like <code>ssh <i>hostname</i> java -jar ~/bin/agent.jar</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, it is often a good idea to write a small shell script, like the following, on an agent
    so that you can control the location of Java and/or agent.jar, as well as set up any
    environment variables specific to this node, such as PATH.
  </p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
exec java -jar ~/bin/agent.jar
</pre>

  <p>
    You can use any command to run a process on the agent machine, such as RSH,
    as long as stdin/stdout of the process on the master will be connected to
    those of <code>java -jar ~/bin/agent.jar</code> on the agent machine eventually.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a larger deployment, it is also worth considering to load <code>agent.jar</code> from
    a NFS-mounted common location, so that you don't have to update this file
    on every agent machines every time you update Jenkins.
  </p>

  <p>
    Setting this to <code>ssh -v <i>hostname</i></code> may be useful for debugging connectivity
    issue.
